# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MongoDB where using the `$in` operator with an empty array returns no results, even when it's expected to return all documents.

## Bug Description
The `$in` operator is typically used to match documents where a field value is present in a given array.  However, when the array is empty, the query returns no documents.  This is counter-intuitive because an empty array should logically mean that any value should match (or none should be excluded).

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `mongod` to start a MongoDB instance.
3. Execute the `bug.js` script.
4. Observe that the query returns an empty array.

## Solution
The correct approach is to use a different query logic when an empty array is passed to handle the case where there are no specific values to match against. The `$in` operator shouldn't be used in such scenarios. We can add a conditional to handle an empty array case separately, effectively returning all documents or applying another filter.

Execute `bugSolution.js` to see the improved logic.
